### How it Works:
Order Up! is a CLI Application that was created as a mini-project for ordering drinks. Through data handling methods, it allows the user to view, manipulate, and otherwise interact with information stored in CSV files and in a database. 
Although simple, the project features a basic ETL pipeline where data is extracted, transformed, and loaded.

This project was undertaken as a part of the Generation Data Engineering Program.
